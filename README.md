## Layout
Only a couple new files have been added to this repo from the template
1. /test_scores/ <= this folder contains .csv, and corresponding .xlsx files for the tests that I ran to determine the best classifier set up
2. /code/pickle_files <= this folder contains the best scoring model as well as the binarizer and vectorizer used
