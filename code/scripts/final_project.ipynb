Forms of Nouns  Inflection in nouns expresses  grammatical category which is number.  Regular forms (adding the suffix  - s)  Irregular forms (Allophones, zero suffix  like  deer, fish, sheep )   4.4 Forms of Pronouns And  Determiners Open classes :  Nouns, Adjectives, Verbs,   Adverbs Determiners:  nouns , display a singular - plural  contrast  P ro - nouns  combine a singular - plural contrast  with contrast unique to them, between  subject and non - subject forms.   T he  distinction between this and  these.  These  are the singular and plural forms of the  determinest lexeme  this.  The  determiners THAT and THIS demonstrate  that number contrasts can have a grammatical  effect inside noun phrase as well as between  subject noun phrases and their accompanying  verbs.   In English, the same technique is used for one  small closed class of lexemes, namely personal  pronouns.  If  one replaces John and Mary with the  appropriate pronouns in these two examples,  the outcome is as in: 1. He  loves her. 2. She  loves him.   He and him are sometimes said to contrast in  case. 1. He belonging to the nominative  case 2. H im belonging to the accusative case .  It  is striking that the relationship between  nominative and accusative forms is  consistently  suppletive . >>  I/me, she/her, we/us, and they/them.    Corresponding words with a possessive  meaning: his and our, as well as my, her, your  and their.  Syntactically and semantically, these words  fulfill just the same role as noun phrases with  the apostrophe - s: 1.  His bicycle  means the bicycle belonging   to him. 2.   bicycle means the bicycle  belonging to that man.  4.5 Forms of  Verbs  In English, a verb lexeme has at most five distinct  forms, as illustrated here with GIVE .  Third person singular present tense e.g . Marry  gives a lecture every year.  Past tense e.g . Marry  gave a lecture last week.  Progressive participle e.g . Mary is  giving a lecture today.  Perfect or passive participle e.g . Mary has  given a lecture today.  Basic form (used everywhere else) e.g Mary wants to  give a lecture.  4.6  Forms of  Adjectives  Many  English adjectives exhibit three forms,  for example GREEN here: 1. Grass  is  green . 2. The  grass is  greener now than in winter. 3. The  grass is  greenest in early summer.  Other adjectives with  similar forms: Positive Comprative Superlative Happy happier happiest Long longer longest Pure purer purest Untidy untidier untidiest Good better best All  these exhibit a regular pattern of suffixation with   er and   est , except for better and best, which are  suppletive .', 'What English sentence could represent the following set of first order logic expressions?
